  <p><strong>All</strong> modern websites and web applications are built using three fundamental technologies:
    HTML, CSS and JavaScript. These are the languages of the web.</p>

  <p>In this post, let's focus on HTML. We will learn what HTML is all
    about, and why you too should learn it.</p>

  <h3>What is HTML?</h3>

  <p> HTML stands for <strong>H</strong>yper<strong>T</strong>ext <strong>M</strong>arkup <strong>L</strong>anguage.
    It's a
    markup language that web developers use to structure and describe the content of a webpage (not a programming
    language).</p>

  <p>HTML consists of elements that describe different types of content: paragraphs, links, headings, images, video,
    etc.
  <p>Web browsers understand HTML and render HTML code as websites.</p>

  <p>In HTML, each element is made up of 3 parts:

    The opening tag
    The closing tag
    The actual element
    You can learn more at the MDN Web Docs.</p>

  <p>
  <h3>Why should you learn HTML?</h3>
  </p>

  <p> There are countless reasons for learning the fundamental language of the web. Here are 5 of them:

    To be able to use the fundamental web dev language
    To hand-craft beautiful websites instead of relying on tools like Worpress or Wix
    To build web applications
    To impress friends
    To have fun ðŸ˜ƒ</p>

  Hopefully you learned something new here. See you next time!</p>
